# Movie Recomendation using Apache Spark
Implemented item-based collaborative filtering manually to recommend movies using Apache Spark for distributed computation (Big data).
Utilises user ratings of the movies as well as genre information to recommend movies.

Arguments taken: 
1. Path to the movies.csv file
2. Path to the ratings.csv file

In code base, I have included the smaller version of these files in the src/main/resources directory. To run locally, these work perfectly.

Data source: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
The larger datasets can be used with the same code to run in cluster.

Inspired by the course "Apache Spark with Scala- Hands On with Big Data!" - Sundog Education by Frank Kane.
